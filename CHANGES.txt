4.0.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- The simplistic Python ``evaluate(expr, locals)`` function has been replaced
  by the `PythonExpressionEvaluator` component, which is an adapter from
  `IProcess` to `IPythonExpressionEvaluator`. The evaluation locals namespace
  is automatically filled with workflow- and application-relevant data
  attributes, the context of the process and the passed in locals variable.

  All calls of `evaluate()` have been updated to use the adapter.

  This change allows for easy replacement of the evaluation engine to hook up
  a safe Python engine (i.e. RestrictedPython) and to provide more namespace
  entries.

- Transition conditions can now be evaluated in the larger context of a
  process, instead of just the workflow-relevant data. Thus their calling
  signature changed from `condition(data)` to `condition(process, data)`.

- `TextCondition` has been changed to use the `PythonExpressionEvaluator`
  component. Also, the compile optimization has been removed, since the
  expression evalautor can do this more effectively.

- Support for aborting processes and activities.

  * Work items can be abortable by implementing ``IAbortWorkItem``.

  * Work items can be cleaned up, if they implement ``ICleanupWorkItem``.

  * Activities keep track of finished work items.

  * Activities can clean themselves up by cleaning up work items.

  * Processes keep track of finished activities.

  * When processes are aborted, the following is done:

    + All activities are aborted.

    + All finished activities are cleaned up.

- Support for reading XPDL-2.1 added
